# Yay!! Intro to OOP - Object Oriented Programming 

learning Date: 1st March, 2022

Preknowledge I have - OOP with python, JavaScript

## Basics & Major topics
* Class
* Object 
* Inheritance 
* Encapsulation 
* Polymorphism 
* Abstraction 


## Class 

> Class is a template from which individual ***object*** can be created.

> And any class type variable are called Object.  
For example `int variableName` is an integer type variable. Same way if a class name is `Student` and we represent an object of Student class type like this `Student Rajo`.   
Here Rajo is a Student type object.
Object hocche class type er variable.  

That's the simplest way to understand Class & Object   


**Declare Class & Object**


```cpp
class className
{
    public:
    //variables
    //Functions
};

//Declaring Object
className objectName;

```
